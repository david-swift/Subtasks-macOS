### Change the Standard Settings Tab and Subtab

This is the settings tab and subtab that appears when you press `⌘,`. Change it to whatever tab you want to see then.

### Change the Usage of the Command key for Navigation and Deletion

Activate a toggle for using the `⌘` key in combination with another key for that action.
