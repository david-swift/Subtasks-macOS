# Getting Started

You can use Subtasks to organize your tasks. You start by [adding][1] tasks to the top-level list you can see when you start the app for the first time. By clicking on such a task, you can view the [subtasks][2]. Those are lists exactly like the top-level list: You can add tasks and another layer of subtasks to them. 

Every task and subtask stores the following information in it:
- A title. The title should concisely state the task. It supports basic Markdown.
- A description for any additional information. It support basic Markdown.
- The completion state. It is either completed or not completed.
- The priority, either high or regular.
- The subtasks.

## Installation
Download Subtasks [here][3].
Note that you cannot open apps that are unsigned directly by double-clicking: You have to Ctrl-click on the `Subtasks.app` file and click on `Open` to open it the first time.

## Development
Subtasks is an open source project. Visit the [GitHub repository][4] for bug reports, feature requests, pull requests and more information.
