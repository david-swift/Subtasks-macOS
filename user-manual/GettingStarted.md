# Getting Started

You can use Subtasks to organize your tasks. You start by [adding][1] tasks to the top-level list you can see when you start the app for the first time. By clicking on such a task, you can view the [subtasks][2]. Those are lists exactly like the top-level list: You can add tasks and another layer of subtasks to them. 

Every task and subtask stores the following information in it:
- A title. The title should concisely state the task. It supports basic Markdown.
- A description for any additional information. It support basic Markdown.
- The completion state. It is either completed or not completed.
- The priority, either high or regular.
- The subtasks.

## Installation
