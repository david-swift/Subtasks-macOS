# Keyboard Shortcuts

You can use keyboard shortcuts to quickly accomplish many tasks in Subtasks. A keyboard-only navigation is possible and probably the most elegant way to use Subtasks.

You can change some shortcuts under `Subtasks` \> `Settings` \> `General` \> `Keyboard Shortcuts`. For more options, go to `` \> `System Settings` \> `Keyboard` \> `Keyboard Shortcuts...`.
